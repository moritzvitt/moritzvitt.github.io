    "english": "Once upon a time in the bustling city of New York, there lived two best friends named Nicholas and Clemens. Despite their personalities being as different as chalk and cheese, they shared a strong bond. Nicholas was a free-spirited poet while Clemens was a meticulous accountant.\n\nOne fair day, they both realized they were falling for each other. It wasn't just friendship anymore, it was love, as crazy and unexpected as the city they lived in. They decided to honor this new feeling by planning an unforgettable trip together.\n\nNicholas, being the extravagant dreamer he was, wanted to go on a safari in Africa to see wild lions and elephants. Clemens, cautious and detailed, made a list of pros and cons about the safari idea. Any surprise there?\n\nIn the end, they chose Clemens' proposal: a quiet but breathtaking mountain trip in Colorado. Nicholas agreed owing to his love for Clemens.\n\nThe day of the trip arrived and the two were bursting with excitement. They packed their car with all essentials plus Nicholas' endless collection of classic poetry books, much to Clemens' amusement.\n\nOnce they reached the mountains, they were awed by the beauty. But they soon discovered that Clemens had forgotten to bring the map. While Clemens went into a mini-panic mode, Nicholas burst into laughter. Now, they had no choice but to rely on their instincts and embark on an adventurous journey.\n\nLaughing, tripping, and experiencing all the unexpected thrills, they fell deeper in love. They learned that when it came to love and laughter, you could really make your way through any situation. \n\nAnd so, despite all the hullabaloo, their trip turned out to be a hit, just like their unexpected love story. It was a grand success, with a beautiful twist of humor. But hey, that's life and love for you!\n",
