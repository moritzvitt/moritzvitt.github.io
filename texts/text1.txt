Title: My Daily Routine

I wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning. First, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then, I have breakfast. I like to eat cereal with milk.

After breakfast, I get dressed for the day. I put on a shirt and pants. I also wear my favorite shoes.

Next, I go to work. I work in an office. I sit at a desk and use a computer. I have lunch at noon. I usually bring a sandwich from home.

In the evening, I come back home around 6 o'clock. I'm tired, so I relax on the sofa and watch TV. Sometimes, I read a book.

For dinner, I cook something simple like pasta or rice. After dinner, I take a shower and get ready for bed. I like to sleep early, so I go to bed at 10 o'clock.

That's my daily routine. It's simple, but I enjoy it.
